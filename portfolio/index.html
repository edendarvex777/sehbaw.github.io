     I am currently an undergrad student at the University of Maryland (College Park), studying Information Science. I have navigated across
     many aspects of the technical field, but have a current interest in data :p  
        
     Most of my work experience has been from a small business standpoint, my first job ever being at a local veteranarian office, where I worked
    with my favorite animals, cats!
        
        Once I realized I had an interest in technology, I chose to work at a place that teaches kids how to code! One of the best ways to truly learn and understand 
        a concept is teaching! I had many roles there, as I tend to try and expand my skillset as much as possible at every organization! Since then, I have spent my time in 
        jobs that have both furthered my knowledge and skills, technically and non technically!
    </p>
 
   <p> I hope to go into public interest technology, finding the intersection of human welfare and technology! I first got into public interest technology in 2020, when the BLM
       movement was at the height of its existence. I fell upon a really cool influencer, Sofia Ongele, who was a prime example of public interest technology for me at the time because
    I was able to see what it actually meant to find the intersection of tech with another subject, especially a humanity subject. </p>
